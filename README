                     Geiser support for Scsh
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an attempt to make Scsh one of the implementations supported
by Geiser (http://geiser.nongnu.org).

Right now hardly anything works. The port is still in progress. And by
``port'', we mean the most basic possible versions of the interfaces
are exported by each module. For example, in many cases when a
procedure can return '() or #f, we do so (pending a better solution to
be implemented later, of course).

For the moment we're only targeting Scsh 0.6.7, the latest
``official'' release from 2006 or so (available at
http://www.scsh.net). Once it's up and running, we can think about
adding support for the newer version being developed here:
https://github.com/scheme/scsh. I really don't know what's involved,
though.

Help from any interested Scheme hackers is, of course, welcome.

(Note that a complementary project is also underway to convert the
Scsh manual to Texinfo here:
