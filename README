                     Geiser support for Scsh
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an attempt to make Scsh one of the implementations supported
by Geiser (http://geiser.nongnu.org).

Right now hardly anything works. The port is still in progress. And by
``port'', we mean only that the most basic possible versions of all of
the interfaces are exported by each module. For example, in cases when
a procedure can return '() or #f, we do so.

For the moment we're only targeting Scsh 0.6.7, the latest
``official'' release from 2006 or so (available at
http://www.scsh.net). Once it's up and running, we can think about adding
support for the newer version being developed here:
https://github.com/scheme/scsh

Help from wizardly Scheme hackers is, of course, welcome.
