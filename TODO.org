  - [ ] evaluation.scm
  - [X] xref.scm (depends on doc.scm)

* TODO Add scsh to Geiser's list of active implementations programmatically

  Figure out how to do this the right way at Geiser load time, so the user doesn't have to
  do M-x customize.

* DONE Port completion.scm

* DONE Port modules.scm

* DONE Port utils.scm to scsh
